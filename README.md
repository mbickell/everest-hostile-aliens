# Hostile Aliens

A challenge to build a simple space invaders like game in <150 lines of code using OOP in just under 2 hours. I opted for an MVC to play the game, consisting of a `Ship` class for handling internal ship logic, `Screen` class for handling DOM interaction and `Game` class to tie both things together.

This was a personal challenge as I had never strict OOP before but overall I am pleased with the result.

Styling was not a requirement for the game.
